            <h3> Summary </h3>
            <p>
                Inspired by the true story of a political murder that horrified Russians in 1869,
                Fyodor Dostoevsky conceived of Demons as a "novel-pamphlet" in which he would say
                everything about the plague of materialist ideology that he saw infecting his native land.
                What emerged was a prophetic and ferociously funny masterpiece of ideology and murder
                in pre-revolutionary Russia.
